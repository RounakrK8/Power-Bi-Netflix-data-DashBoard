# Power-Bi-Netflix-data-DashBoard
Power BI data analytics case study involving data cleaning, transformation, and modeling using Power Query. Built DAX measures and interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, slicers, and filters to analyze trends and comparisons, demonstrating end-to-end Power BI reporting and analytics skills.
This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study developed using Microsoft Power BI, aimed at converting raw data into meaningful, interactive insights. The primary goal of this project was to understand the dataset deeply, clean and transform the data, build a proper data model, and present insights through an intuitive dashboard.

The workflow starts with data extraction and transformation using Power Query, where unnecessary columns were removed, data types were corrected, and inconsistencies were handled. After preparing the dataset, relationships between tables were established to create a structured data model suitable for analysis.

Key business metrics were calculated using DAX measures, enabling dynamic analysis across different dimensions. The final report consists of multiple visuals such as charts, tables, and KPI indicators, supported by slicers and filters to allow user-driven exploration of the data. These visuals help identify trends, patterns, and comparisons clearly and effectively.

This project reflects practical experience in building real-world Power BI dashboards and demonstrates the ability to combine data modeling, analytical thinking, and visualization best practices into a single reporting solution.
